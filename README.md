        <p>Since I was little, I have always had a passion for computers. At around age 11, I started asking questions to myself like: How are websites made? Or: Can I make my own website? I did some research, and I saw some computer languages that I would like to learn. I wanted to learn html, css, and java script. I found that those were the computer languages that make up websites that I use everyday! After some looking online for ways to learn, I came across an amazing website called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">khan academy</a>. After learning some basic html and css, I decided that I would like to try to write my own code all by myself. I found a website called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.repl.it/">Repl.it</a>. I played around for a while, and made some basic pages called repls.</p>
